Some time ago I read an interesting post on the [Elttam](https://www.elttam.com.au/blog)
(an infosec company) blog, and I decided to take a look on the rest of the webpage.
I don't know how, but I ended on the [jobs section](https://www.elttam.com.au/careers/),
where a little challenge has to be completed before applying.

I didn't have any intention to apply, because I don't think I have the skills they're
searching for (basically, because I haven't even ended the degree yet...); but the
challenge seemed fun, so I decided to give it a shot.

**NOTE: I've changed some of the data to not reveal the real solution of the
challenge, although the methodology to solve it is exactly the same.**

The first thing to do is to get the hexdump and reverse it, to see what data is being
represented. Maybe we can find some recognizable format. I'm doing everything in just
one step, so there's an extra `0d 0a 00` at the end (that doesn't affect us in any way):

```

It turns out that it's a POST request, and there are a couple of clues on the parameters:
  - **q**: The email address is hidden in this request
  - **bonus**: What is source IP address

Now we must find those two things.

### Email address

As stated by the first clue, the email address has to be hidden somewhere on the request,
so we can try to find it first on the other parameters of the request... like the cookie.
Lets see what does that base64 encoded string decode to:
```sh
$ cat - | base64 -d
ZW1haWw9MWMwMDA0MGQyNTAwMDkxMTExMDQwODRiMDYwYTA4NGIwNDEw
email=1c00040d250009111104084b060a084b0410
```

Great! We have an email address that doesn't look like an address at all...
The address [**MUST**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1) have a local
part (some string, using a subset of ASCII, to identify the mail account), an '@'
symbol, and then a domain string (using another, more restrictive, subset of ASCII).
Thus, that hexadecimal string that we're given has to be encoded or enciphered.

The tries to decode the string doesn't pay off, so lets have a closer look at the
string, taking for granted that it's a cipher, and start assuming that it's a simple
substitution cipher. As with any other cipher, the first thing is to count the different
used symbols:
```
String: 1c 00 04 0d 25 00 09 11 11 04 08 4b 06 0a 08 4b 04 10

Count:
    Symbol    Count
      1c       1
      00       2
      04       3
      0d       1
      25       1
      00       1
      09       1
      11       2
      04       2
      0a       1
      08       2
      4b       2
      06       1
      10       1
```

There's not a lot of information there... Maybe 0x04 is an 'e', but there's not enough
text to conclude anything.

Anyway, we can try to extract some information from there; because, as I said before, the
email addresses have a clearly defined format (`<local>@<domain>`), and the domain will
most likely be `elttam.au`, or `elttam.com.au`; or something like that.

If this is a monoalphabetic substitution (meaning that every character is enciphered
always with the same character) and the domain is `elttam.<something>`, that pattern
should be visible at the end of the string (the domain part).

There's only one position where a symbol is repeated two times, one after another (that
would be the 'tt' part of 'elttam'), so there's only one candidate:
```
1c 00 04 0d 25 00 09 11 11 04 08 4b 06 0a 08 4b 04 10
                e  l  t  t  a  m
```

With that info, we can try to recover some other parts of the text (again, only if our
initial assumption is right):
```
1c 00 04 0d 25 00 09 11 11 04 08 4b 06 0a 08 4b 04 10
                e  l  t  t  a  m           m     a
```

That's not much text; but enough to make us thing of one of the possible domains:
```
1c 00 04 0d 25 00 09 11 11 04 08 4b 06 0a 08 4b 04 10
                e  l  t  t  a  m  .  c  o  m  .  a  u
```

Now we can say with some confidence that we're on the right track. Now, we should recover
the encipherment method. One thing that can help us is to note that the cipher generates
binary data (non-printable characters), so it's almost sure that it's not about the
classical methods (VigenÃ¨re, Caesar...), but a relatively modern one, maybe operating at
the bit level. The first thing coming to our minds is
[Vernam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Vernam#The_Vernam_cipher). Now it's time
to test this hypothesis:
```sh
$ cat - > /dev/null
# Hex char codes (can be consulted with `man ascii`):
e -> 0x65
l -> 0x6c
t -> 0x74
a -> 0x61
m -> 0x6d
$ # First test to recover the key: 'e' xor 0x00 (obviously, it will be 'e')
$ printf "%#x\n" "$((0x65 ^ 0x00))"
0x65
$ # Second test: 'l' xor 0x09
$ printf "%#x\n" "$((0x6c ^ 0x09))"
0x65
$ # Okay, I'm going to say that the key is 0x65 ('e')
$ printf "%#x\n" "$((0x74 ^ 0x11))"
0x65
$ # Wow! What a surprise! I didn't expect it to be 0x65 at all...
$ printf "%#x\n" "$((0x61 ^ 0x04))"
0x65
```

Well, that's enough. Definitely, the algorithm used is to xor every character with 'e'.

Now, we only have to recover the whole address. I used this simple Python script:
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import binascii

mail = "1c00040d250009111104084b060a084b0410"
key = ord ("e")

arr = [ mail [i:(i + 2)] for i in xrange (0, len (mail), 2) ]

xored = [ key ^ int (elem, 16) for elem in arr ]

print "Mail address: " \
    + "".join ( [ binascii.unhexlify (hex (x).lstrip ("0x")) for x in xored ] )
```

And we finnaly have the mail address (as I said before, that's not the real address):
```sh
$ ./decrypt_mail.py
Mail address: yeah@elttam.com.au
```

### The source IP

This is a simpler task, as we only have to read the bytes of packet and, as it has a
standarized format, get the source IP. To do that, we can use a tool like
[scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) and simply build the packet with the
request and read the data:
```python
>>> data = open ("dump.bin").read ()
>>> Ether (data)
<Ether  dst=2c:54:2d:f0:0d:2a src=08:00:27:c3:59:62 type=0x800 |<IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=417 id=62259 flags=DF frag=0L ttl=64 proto=tcp chksum=0xbd8d src=192.168.123.45 dst=104.105.106.107 options=[] |<TCP  sport=34960 dport=http seq=3385423760 ack=535155389 dataofs=5L reserved=0L flags=PA window=229 chksum=0x8a29 urgptr=0 options=[] |<Raw  load='POST /career HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.elttam.com.au\r\nUser-Agent: elttam rocks!\r\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nCookie: ZW1haWw9MWMwMDA0MGQyNTAwMDkxMTExMDQwODRiMDYwYTA4NGIwNDEw\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nContent-Length: 81\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\nq=The+email+address+is+hidden+in+this+request&bonus=What+is+source+IP+address\r\n\r\n' |<Padding  load='\x00' |>>>>>
```

And, just like that, we have the source and destination IP addresses (as the email, they
have been changed):
  - **Source**: 192.168.123.45
  - **Destination**: 104.105.106.107



That's all, folks!

I think it's good when sometimes  companies do these kind of challenges to filter out
candidates and avoid spam (just in case there's some bot scraping email addresses on
the wild). Also, it's quite fun and I enjoyed the time it took me to complete it.
