Yesterday I gave a little talk about _anonimity, privacy and security_, and I said that
I'd upload the slideshow, so here it is.

The topic was so broad that I left a lot of things out of the presentation, and other
ones were left without sufficiently deep explanation (even though I was talking for
almost two hours...), but I hope to have more opportunities to talk about these subjects
and extend and polish some concepts.

I leave this slides free (as in freedom) to use to whoever wants to give their own
presentations, allowing them to make modifications and whatever they want to do with
the slides.

Basically, you can do whatever you like with them. If you want the original .odt to
modify anything, just ask me and I'll give it to you.

I'd also like that, if you see something that's wrong or make a change to the slideshow,
you'd tell me for me to fix it as soon as possible.

Enjoy them, and I hope they help someone who's interested on privacy, anonimity or
security.
