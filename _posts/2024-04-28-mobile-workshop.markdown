A year or two ago I created a small workshop to introduce my work colleagues to the basics of Mobile Application testing.

Since then, the [Mobile Application Security Testing Guide](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/) has seen a reorganisation, and both Android and iOS have introduced new security and privacy measures in their systems.
Nevertheless, the basics of application testing are still the same.
In my opinion, the information below is still relevant to get an introduction on mobile app testing.

And, as I had the materials laying around, I thought it would be nice to publis them here.

Hopefully someone finds it useful :)
