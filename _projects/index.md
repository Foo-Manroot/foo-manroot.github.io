## Introduction

These are the projects that I've been working on. Most pof them are side-projects hosted
on Github, but there are also some college assignments (also hosted on Github), and some
little ones that are not even hosted anywhere but here, as no version control is needed.

All the projects are open-source, so anybody is free to contribute to make them better.

helpful.
