## Collatz

This project was created as a response to a internship offer, where we were told to
create a simple program to calculate the
[Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

As I saw that the repository was no longer needed, I decide to use it to train my
knowledge on different languages, and learn new ones. Every directory is dedicated to
one implementation on a given language. In these directories there should be another
README to explain how to run the program, if needed (even without any instructions, it
should be pretty straight-forward).

Also, this repository can be used to back my claims of knowledge (at least on a basic
level) on a given language.


### Languages

These are the currently available iumplementations, each one in their corresponding
directory:

  - C (this was the original, the one used for the internship offer)
  - Scala
  - Bash
  - Lisp
  - Prolog
  - Python
  - PHP
  - Java
  - LOLCODE
  - Ruby
  - AWK
