## Literate octo umbrella

This project was made to create the program needed in our '_Advanced Programming II_'
course where we were asked to do a game similar to Candy Crush, fully in Scala only with
functional programming tools.

To execute any of the multiple version that were asked (one with GUI, and other without
it), just compile everything (there's a script for that purpose named `script.sh`) and
execute it. To execute the gui part, the main class to use is `GUI_main`.

We didn't have time to give it a name (nor we wanted to), so we chose the name
automatically suggested by Github.
