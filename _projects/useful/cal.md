## CAL

Chat A Lot.

This is a project to build a fully peer to peer chat. The intention is not to have any
server, so it can be used from the very first moment even on local networks without
connection to the internet.

It has some cool functionalities like command autocompletion; but there's a lot of work
to do.


Should work well on LANs, but when a NAT is between the hosts, the chat is no more able
to send message. That should be one of the main things to work on.
