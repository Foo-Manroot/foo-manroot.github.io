## Tools

The objective for this project is to have a list with all the tools that I (or someone
else) may need. The ultimate goal is to be able to install and use all this tools on
fresh installations of, at least, Debian-based distributions (specifically aimed at
Ubuntu).

Apart from the main script, `installer.sh` with its auxiliary data (`tools.json`,
`aux_installers`...), there is also a directory with a configuration for vim (with its
`vimrc` and syntax files).
