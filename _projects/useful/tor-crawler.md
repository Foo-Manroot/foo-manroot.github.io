## Tor crawler


Little program to crawl some ToR pages and demonstrate the usage of the Stem API to
connect ToR from within Python 3.

Made by [ **Foo-Manroot** ](https://foo-manroot.github.io/)

Last change on **Feb 04, 2018**

The API used to interact with the ToR proxy is [stem](https://stem.torproject.org/)
To check the external IP, [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) was used (although it should
be changed after connecting to ToR, to avoid linking the original IP with the new one).


## Motivation

This is a quick PoC (it has very basic features) to demonstrate the usage of ToR from
within Python, using the [stem API](https://stem.torproject.org/), for the course
_Security on Distributed Systems_, where the professor invited us to do anything with
the things learned in the previous class ( _introdution to ToR_ ).


## Examples

For testing purposes I used the [Intel Exchange](http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/) forum,
as there should only be innocuous materials (no drugs, nor anything illegal).

Also, the output will be redirected to a file called `output.log`. This file will be
distributed (with the used IP changed, for privacy reasons) to be used as an example.


### Crawling the clearnet through ToR

This is a usage example, crawling the default webpage (a normal web on the clearnet)
using ToR:
```sh
$ time ./main.py
 => The original IP address is: <ORIGINAL IP>
 => Starting ToR
[12:32:13] DEBUG - System call: tor --version (runtime: 0.02)
 => ToR started
 => New IP: <A DIFFERENT IP, PROVIDED BY TOR>

### Crawling the darknet

For this test, the starting point will be Intel Exchange's
["Wheelwork of Nature"](http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=category&id=15) category,
using a different port, setting the recursion depth to 1 (to show only the posts on that
category) and redirecting the output to `output.log`:
```sh
$ time ./main.py -d 1 -p 5678 -u "http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion/?cmd=category&id=15" | tee output.log
 => The original IP address is: <ORIGINAL IP>
 => Starting ToR
[12:21:38] DEBUG - System call: tor --version (runtime: 0.02)
 => ToR started
 => New IP: <A DIFFERENT IP, PROVIDED BY TOR>
