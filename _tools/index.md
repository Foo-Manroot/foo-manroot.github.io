## Introduction

In this page you'll find some tools that I find useful, either made by myself or by
others. Most of this tools should be available on
[my 'tools' project](../projects/useful/tools), with which one can simply install them
all (or only the desired ones).

This tools are divided by category. As a tool may serve to multiple purposes, there can
be duplicated entries.
