### About me
I'm {% include icon-github.html username="Foo-Manroot" %}, (on Github
and most places on the internet), a Computer Science Student. I've almost finished
my degree, so I though that I could share my knowledge (about CS-related themes) with
the world.

I'm very interested on cybersecurity and my main goal is to work as a pentester or
something similar (red team stuff). For the moment, I just like to complete the
challenges on sites like [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/) or
[id0-rsa](https://id0-rsa.pub/); and participate on **_CTF_ competitions**. By the way,
if somebody wants to create a team or looks for members, just contact me (info is on the
footer) and I'll be happy to colaborate.

Also, you can check my profile on keybase:

### About the blog
The main topics on this page will be revolving around cybersecurity stuff; but maybe
some posts will have different issues... who knows?


On the other hand, aside from the normal posts, there's a section dedicated exclusively
to my [personal projects](../projects), where I explain in detail their characteristics.

This blog is made with {% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). You can find the source of this page on
[my Github](https://github.com/Foo-Manroot/foo-manroot.github.io).
