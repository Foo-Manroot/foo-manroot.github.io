These are some links of other blogs and some resources that I think that may be useful
for anybody who wants to go deeper on the topics I talk about in this blog (SDR, CTFs,
or whatever).

## SDR

  - [rtl-sdr.com](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/): Collection of different projects and news
	regarding SDR and other HAM radio topics. This is a good starting point to
	introduce yourself in this world, as there are a lot of ideas for side projects,
	tutorials, tips... There's also a store where you can buy hardware and there are
	alsdoo you need according to your goals.


  - [batchdrake.github.io](https://batchdrake.github.io/): Blog of a well known Spanish
	researcher who has a deep knowledge on the technical side of radio communications
	(I think he's a telecommunications engineer, which I am not, hence my lack of
	knowledge on the matter XD). I've attended to his talk in the _RootedCon X_
	(2019) and I think he did a pretty good job both at the technical level and at
	the presentation.


  - [hackerdecabecera.com](https://www.hackerdecabecera.com/) (SPANISH only): Blog of a
	guy with whom I coincide in some Telegram groups regarding SDR hacking and
	similar stuff. His posts are quite interesting and I recommend to take a look at
	that site.
